        <h1>The Reserve Bank of Australia in Action</h1>
        <p>Australia's economic rhythm is quietly shaped by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Through monetary policy, the Bank sets the tone for interest rates, manages liquidity, and steers inflation toward stability. Each adjustment to the cash rate or shift in its balance sheet reflects a broader balancing act - keeping prices steady, supporting jobs, and navigating the ripple effects of global markets. This visualization explores how those levers work in practice and the forces that guide them.</p>

        <h2>Monetary Policy: Interest Rate Corridor</h2>
        <div id="vis1" class="vis-container"></div>
        <p>The interest rate corridor is the RBA's main framework for guiding short-term interest rates. 
          At its centre sits the <span class="highlight-Cash-Rate">cash rate target</span> - the rate the RBA wants banks to lend to each other overnight. 
          The <span class="highlight-Exchange-Settlement-Rate">exchange settlement rate</span> forms the floor of the corridor, as it's the rate the RBA pays on funds that banks hold in their accounts at the central bank. 
          The <span class="highlight-Overnight-Repo-Rate">overnight repo rate</span> sets the ceiling, as it's the rate banks pay to borrow cash from the RBA using securities as collateral. 
          By keeping market rates trading within this narrow band, the RBA ensures that the cost of money in the economy stays close to its policy target.</p>

        <h2>Monetary Policy: Banknotes in Circulation</h2>
        <div id="vis2" class="vis-container"></div>
        <p>The total value of banknotes in circulation shows how much physical cash Australians are holding at any point in time. 
          When people or businesses need more cash-like during periods of strong spending or uncertainty - the RBA increases supply through the banking system. 
          Although most transactions are now digital, the amount of cash in circulation has risen steadily over time, driven by population growth, higher prices, 
          and the continued demand to hold cash as a secure store of value.</p>

          <h2>The Influence of Unemployment</h2>
          <div id="vis3" class="vis-container"></div>
          <p>Unemployment is one of the key signals the RBA watches when setting monetary policy. 
            High joblessness means spare capacity in the economy - people want to work, 
            but demand is too weak - so the RBA tends to lower interest rates to encourage spending and hiring. 
            When unemployment falls and labour markets tighten, wage and price pressures rise, prompting the Bank to raise rates to keep inflation in check. 
            Mapping unemployment across regions, age groups, and genders reveals where the economy's strengths and stresses lie - insights that 
            help shape how the RBA's policy supports a more balanced recovery.</p>

          <p>The inflation rate is the rate at which the price of goods and services is increasing. The inflation rate is measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The CPI is a measure of the price of a basket of goods and services that are representative of the typical Australian household. The inflation rate is measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
