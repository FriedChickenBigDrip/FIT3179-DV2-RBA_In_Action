        <h1>The Reserve Bank of Australia in Action</h1>
        <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia sets policy with a single question in mind: how do we keep inflation low and stable while supporting full employment and the prosperity of Australians? This chart turns that judgement call into its core building blocks. The labour market shows capacity jobs, hours, and wages. Inflation tracks price pressures against the 2-3% target. Economic growth captures momentum in output and demand. Overseas factors; global rates, trade, commodity prices, and financial conditions—wash onto our shores and shape local conditions. And, at times, extraordinary shocks like COVID or natural disasters overwhelm the usual signals.</p>

        <p>Viewed together, these components form the RBA's dashboard. As one dial moves, the others matter more or less. Use the visual to see how shifts in each area can tilt the policy calculus, and why the same data can lead to different decisions at different moments.</p>

        <h2>Monetary Policy: Interest Rate Corridor</h2>
        <p>Monetary policy, at its core, is the RBA setting the price of overnight money and letting that price ripple through the rest of the economy. It does this with an interest-rate corridor: the cash rate target sits in the middle—the price banks aim to trade Exchange Settlement (ES) balances at—bounded below by the interest on ES balances (a floor: no bank will lend cheaper than what it can earn risk-free at the RBA) and above by the rate the RBA charges when it lends overnight against collateral via repo (often shown as the reverse-repo/standing facility rate—the ceiling). These guardrails keep actual overnight trades hugging the middle line on your chart. When the RBA wants to tighten or ease, it shifts the whole corridor up or down by moving the cash rate target (with the floor and ceiling moving in step). That single price change transmits to bank funding costs, loan and deposit rates, spending and investment—ultimately steering inflation and employment.</p>
        <div id="vis1" class="vis-container"></div>
        <p>The corridor is the band you see above—cash rate target in the middle, ES balance rate as the floor, and the RBA’s standing facility/reverse-repo rate as the ceiling. It looks especially narrow during the 2008 GFC and the 2020 COVID lockdown because the RBA flooded the system with ES balances to keep markets calm, which pulled the traded cash rate down toward the floor; in 2020 the floor was set near zero as well, compressing the band itself.</p>
        <h2>Monetary Policy: Banknotes in Circulation</h2>
        <p>The RBA prints banknotes to keep the economy moving. It controls the amount of banknotes in circulation with an auction system that banks bid for. The bids are matched to the supply, and the winning bids determine the amount of banknotes in circulation. The RBA uses this system to control the money supply and influence economic activity.</p>
